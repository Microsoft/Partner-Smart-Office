        "ApplicationSecretId": "NAME-OF-SECRET-FOR-THE-APP-IN-KEYVAULT",
        "ServiceAddress": "https://graph.microsoft.com",
        "TenantId": "INSERT-THE-TENANT-ID-HERE"
    },
    "EnvironmentType": "CSP",
    "FriendlyName": "INSERT FRIENDLY NAME HERE",
    "id": "INSERT-THE-TENANT-ID-HERE",
    "PartnerCenterEndpoint": {
        "ApplicationId": "INSERT-THE-PC-APP-ID-HERE",
        "ApplicationSecretId": "NAME-OF-SECRET-FOR-THE-APP-IN-KEYVAULT",
        "ServiceAddress": "https://api.partnercenter.microsoft.com",
        "TenantId": "INSERT-THE-TENANT-ID-HERE"
    }
}
```

        "ApplicationSecretId": "NAME-OF-SECRET-FOR-THE-APP-IN-KEYVAULT",
        "ServiceAddress": "https://graph.microsoft.com",

    },
    "EnvironmentType": "EA",
